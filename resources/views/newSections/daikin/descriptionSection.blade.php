				In a fast-paced manufacturing facility, durability is important in the public spaces. People and equipment move up and down corridors many times each day. Solid surface was chosen for a number of reasons:<br><br>

				<ul>
					<li>Can be shaped into the sinuous forms to represent air</li>
					<li>Easily cleanable and repairable</li> 
					<li>With proper techniques, joints can appear seamless</li> 
				</ul><br><br> 

				Understanding the properties of advanced materials allows us to offer the best solution for the time and budget allowable.
